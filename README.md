**Key Insights:**
- **Cumulative Sales & Profit Contribution**:  
  The Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule) reveals that a few key sub-categories drive most of the sales and profit.  
  Top contributors to total sales include Phones, Chairs, Storage, and Binders, while Copiers, Phones, and Accessories contribute the most to profit.  
  Some sub-categories (e.g., Tables and Supplies) contribute negative profit, which may require pricing or cost structure adjustments.

- **Cumulative Percentage Analysis**:  
  80% of total sales come from a small subset of sub-categories, reinforcing the Pareto Principle.  
  The visualization of cumulative profit shows outliers that negatively impact profitability, highlighting areas for cost reduction or pricing optimization.

**Possible Business Actions:**
- Prioritize high-contribution sub-categories (Phones, Copiers, Binders) for promotions, stock management, and investment.
- Reassess pricing and cost structures for low-profit or negative-profit categories like Tables.
- Use data-driven forecasting to optimize inventory and reduce holding costs for low-performing sub-categories.
